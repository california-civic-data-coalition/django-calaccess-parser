That Committee's identification number was 1379378.  The California Taxpayer Protection Committee was not otherwise financially involved with this campaign.  The contribution was originally made on October 19, 2015 and it was mailed to 2973 Sunnybrook Drive in Los Angeles, California.  That check was allegedly lost in the mail, so a second check (the replacement check) was then  mailed to the same committee at a different address: 514 South Shatto Place (Third Floor) in Los Angeles, California.
